# Appointment Reminder System - Updates Summary

**Date:** September 24, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

## 🎉 New Features Added

### 1. Business Owner Notifications ✅

When a customer books an appointment, business owners and managers are now **instantly notified**.

**Implementation:**
- New method: `sendAppointmentBookedNotification()` in `NotificationService`
- Notifies all active OWNER and MANAGER staff members
- Includes customer name, service, and appointment time
- Multi-language support (TR/EN)
- Deduplicates notifications (same user won't get multiple)

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Automatically called when appointment is created
await notificationService.sendAppointmentBookedNotification({
  id: appointmentId,
  businessId: businessId,
  customerId: customerId,
  startTime: appointmentTime,
  service: { name: serviceName },
  customer: { firstName, lastName, phoneNumber }
});
```

**Notification Example:**
- **Turkish:** "Ahmet Yılmaz tarafından Saç Kesimi hizmeti için 24.09.2025 14:30 tarihinde randevu alındı."
- **English:** "New appointment booked by Ahmet Yılmaz for Haircut at 24.09.2025 14:30."
