# Staff-Specific Timeline Implementation

## Problem Identified
The appointment system had a fundamental architectural flaw where it was designed as a single timeline for all staff in a business, rather than individual staff-specific timelines as per industry standards.

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Database Design**: `staffId` was optional in appointments
2. **Service Logic**: Staff members saw ALL business appointments instead of only their own
3. **Conflict Checking**: Appointments were checked for business-wide conflicts instead of staff-specific conflicts
4. **No Individual Timelines**: Staff couldn't have separate schedules

## Industry Standard Implementation

### New Architecture:
1. **Every appointment MUST have a staff member assigned**
2. **Each staff member has their own timeline**
3. **Staff see only their own appointments**
4. **Owners/Managers can view all staff timelines**
5. **Conflict checking is staff-specific**

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- ✅ Made `staffId` required (no longer optional)
- ✅ Updated foreign key relationship to be non-nullable
- ✅ Added composite index for efficient staff-specific queries: `[staffId, date, startTime]`

### 2. Repository Layer (`src/repositories/appointmentRepository.ts`)
- ✅ **NEW METHOD**: `findByStaffMember()` - Get appointments for specific staff member
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `findByUserBusinesses()` - Now supports staff filtering
- ✅ **FIXED**: `findConflictingAppointments()` - Now staff-specific conflict checking

### 3. Service Layer (`src/services/appointmentService.ts`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `getMyAppointments()` - Role-based timeline filtering:
  - **Staff**: See only their own appointments
  - **Owner/Manager**: See all appointments (with optional staff filter)
- ✅ **NEW METHOD**: `getStaffAppointments()` - For owners/managers to view specific staff timelines
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `getBusinessAppointments()` - Support staff filtering
- ✅ **FIXED**: All conflict checking now staff-specific

### 4. Controller Layer (`src/controllers/appointmentController.ts`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `getMyAppointments()` - Added `staffId` query parameter support
- ✅ **NEW METHOD**: `getStaffAppointments()` - View specific staff member's timeline
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `getBusinessAppointments()` - Support staff filtering

### 5. Routes (`src/routes/v1/appointments.ts`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: `/my-appointments` route documentation to include `staffId` parameter
- ✅ **FIXED**: `/staff/:staffId` route to use correct controller method

### 6. Database Migration (`src/migrations/make-staff-required-for-appointments.sql`)
- ✅ **DATA MIGRATION**: Assigns existing appointments without staff to business owners
- ✅ **SCHEMA CHANGE**: Makes `staffId` NOT NULL
- ✅ **PERFORMANCE**: Adds optimized indexes for staff-specific queries
- ✅ **SAFETY**: Includes verification steps and rollback safety

## API Usage Examples

### Staff Member Timeline (Staff users)
```http
GET /api/v1/appointments/my-appointments
# Returns only the staff member's own appointments
```

### Owner/Manager View All Appointments
```http
GET /api/v1/appointments/my-appointments
# Returns all appointments across all staff members
```

### Owner/Manager View Specific Staff Timeline
```http
GET /api/v1/appointments/my-appointments?staffId=staff_123
# Returns only appointments for staff_123
```

### Direct Staff Timeline Access
```http
GET /api/v1/appointments/staff/staff_123
# Returns appointments for specific staff member (with permissions)
```

## Migration Instructions

1. **Backup Database** before running migration
2. **Run Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the migration script
   psql -d randevubu -f src/migrations/make-staff-required-for-appointments.sql
   ```
3. **Verify Data Integrity**:
   ```sql
   -- Check all appointments have staff
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT("staffId") as with_staff FROM appointments;

   -- Test staff-specific queries
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE "staffId" = 'some_staff_id';
   ```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Industry Standard Compliance
- Each staff member now has individual timeline
- Appointments cannot exist without staff assignment
- Staff-specific conflict checking prevents double-booking

### ✅ Performance Improvements
- New composite indexes optimize staff-specific queries
- Reduced data transfer (staff see only relevant appointments)
- Efficient conflict checking

### ✅ User Experience
- **Staff**: Clean, focused view of only their appointments
- **Owners**: Full oversight with ability to drill down to specific staff
- **Managers**: Balanced view based on permissions

### ✅ Data Integrity
- No orphaned appointments without staff
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Atomic migration with verification

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test new repository methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify API endpoints return correct data
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure staff-specific queries are efficient
4. **User Acceptance Tests**: Verify role-based timeline visibility

## Rollback Plan
If needed, the migration can be rolled back by:
1. Making `staffId` nullable again
2. Removing the composite index
3. Reverting service logic (though this loses the staff-specific benefits)

**Note**: Consider creating a comprehensive test suite before deploying to production.
