## Backend Methods Required

### API Endpoints to Implement

#### 1. Enhanced Closure Creation
```typescript
POST /api/v1/closures/enhanced
{
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  reason: string;
  type: 'VACATION' | 'MAINTENANCE' | 'EMERGENCY' | 'OTHER';
  notifyCustomers: boolean;
  notificationMessage?: string;
  notificationChannels: ('EMAIL' | 'SMS' | 'PUSH')[];
  affectedServices?: string[]; // Service IDs
  isRecurring: boolean;
  recurringPattern?: {
    frequency: 'WEEKLY' | 'MONTHLY' | 'YEARLY';
    interval: number;
    endDate?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 2. Customer Notification Service
```typescript
POST /api/v1/notifications/closure
{
  closureId: string;
  channels: ('EMAIL' | 'SMS' | 'PUSH')[];
  message: string;
  customTemplate?: string;
}
```

#### 3. Affected Appointments Management
```typescript
GET /api/v1/closures/{id}/affected-appointments
POST /api/v1/closures/{id}/reschedule-suggestions
POST /api/v1/closures/{id}/notify-customers
```

#### 4. Waitlist and Availability Notifications
```typescript
POST /api/v1/businesses/{id}/availability-alerts
GET /api/v1/businesses/{id}/closure-status
POST /api/v1/customers/notify-availability
```

#### 5. Closure Analytics
```typescript
GET /api/v1/closures/analytics
{
  period: string;
  metrics: ['FREQUENCY', 'REVENUE_IMPACT', 'CUSTOMER_IMPACT'];
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions

#### Closures Table Enhancement
```sql
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN notify_customers BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN notification_message TEXT;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN notification_channels JSON;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN affected_services JSON;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN is_recurring BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN recurring_pattern JSON;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN created_appointments_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE closures ADD COLUMN notified_customers_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Customer Availability Alerts
CREATE TABLE availability_alerts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
  service_id UUID REFERENCES services(id),
  preferred_dates JSON,
  notification_preferences JSON,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Closure Notifications Log
CREATE TABLE closure_notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  closure_id UUID REFERENCES closures(id),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  channel VARCHAR(10) CHECK (channel IN ('EMAIL', 'SMS', 'PUSH')),
  message TEXT,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Appointment Reschedule Suggestions
CREATE TABLE reschedule_suggestions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  original_appointment_id UUID REFERENCES appointments(id),
  closure_id UUID REFERENCES closures(id),
  suggested_dates JSON,
  customer_response VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Service Layer Methods to Implement

### 1. NotificationService
```typescript
class NotificationService {
  async sendClosureNotification(
    customerId: string,
    closureData: EnhancedClosureData,
    channels: NotificationChannel[]
  ): Promise<NotificationResult>;

  async sendAvailabilityAlert(
    customerId: string,
    businessId: string,
    availableSlots: TimeSlot[]
  ): Promise<NotificationResult>;

  async sendRescheduleNotification(
    appointmentId: string,
    suggestions: RescheduleSuggestion[]
  ): Promise<NotificationResult>;
}
```

### 2. ClosureAnalyticsService
```typescript
class ClosureAnalyticsService {
  async getClosureImpactAnalytics(
    businessId: string,
    period: DateRange
  ): Promise<ClosureAnalytics>;

  async getCustomerImpactReport(
    closureId: string
  ): Promise<CustomerImpactReport>;

  async getRevenueImpactAnalysis(
    businessId: string,
    closureData: ClosureData
  ): Promise<RevenueImpact>;
}
```

### 3. AppointmentRescheduleService
```typescript
class AppointmentRescheduleService {
  async getAffectedAppointments(
    closureId: string
  ): Promise<Appointment[]>;

  async generateRescheduleSuggestions(
    appointmentId: string,
    closureData: ClosureData
  ): Promise<RescheduleSuggestion[]>;

  async autoRescheduleAppointments(
    closureId: string,
    rescheduleOptions: RescheduleOptions
  ): Promise<RescheduleResult[]>;
}
```
