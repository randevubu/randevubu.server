# Services to Staff Migration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the service attachment structure from business-level to staff-level ownership, including functionality to copy owner services to staff members.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Service Model**: Added `staffId` field as primary owner identifier
- **BusinessStaff Model**: Added `ownedServices` relation for staff-owned services
- **ServiceStaff Model**: Repurposed for additional staff assignments beyond primary ownership
- **Migration File**: Created `src/migrations/20250116000000_services_to_staff.sql`

### 2. Repository Layer (`src/repositories/serviceRepository.ts`)
**Updated Methods:**
- `create()`: Now requires `staffId` parameter
- `findById()`, `findByBusinessId()`, `findActiveByBusinessId()`: Include staff relationship data

**New Methods:**
- `findByStaffId()`: Get services owned by specific staff member
- `findActiveByStaffId()`: Get active services owned by specific staff member
- `copyServicesFromStaff()`: Copy services from one staff member to another
- `getOwnerServicesByBusinessId()`: Get services owned by business owner

### 3. Business Repository (`src/repositories/businessRepository.ts`)
**New Helper Methods:**
- `findStaffByUserAndBusiness()`: Find user's staff record for a business
- `findStaffRecord()`: Get staff record by ID
- `findOwnerStaff()`: Find owner staff record for a business

### 4. Service Layer (`src/services/serviceService.ts`)
**Updated Methods:**
- `createService()`: Auto-assigns to user's staff record if no `staffId` provided
- `duplicateService()`: Creates service under user's staff record

**New Methods:**
- `getServicesByStaffId()`: Get services for a specific staff member
- `copyOwnerServicesToStaff()`: Copy owner's services to another staff member
- `getOwnerServices()`: Get all services owned by business owner

### 5. API Layer (`src/controllers/serviceController.ts` & `src/routes/v1/services.ts`)
**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/services/staff/{staffId}`: Get services owned by specific staff
- `GET /api/v1/services/business/{businessId}/owner-services`: Get owner services
- `POST /api/v1/services/business/{businessId}/staff/{staffId}/copy-owner-services`: Copy owner services to staff

### 6. Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `businessMaintenanceService.ts`
- Updated Prisma relations to maintain consistency
- Fixed JSON type handling in service copying

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Staff Service Ownership
- Services are now primarily owned by individual staff members
- Each service has a `staffId` that identifies its owner
- Maintains business context through `businessId` for filtering and permissions

### 2. Service Copying Functionality
- **Copy All**: `POST /copy-owner-services` without `serviceIds`
- **Copy Specific**: `POST /copy-owner-services` with `serviceIds` array
- Preserves all service properties (name, duration, price, etc.)
- Generates unique IDs for copied services
- Automatically assigns correct business and staff context

### 3. Permission-Based Access
- Maintains existing RBAC permission structure
- `MANAGE_ALL_SERVICES`: Global service management
- `MANAGE_OWN_SERVICES`: Business-scoped service management
- `VIEW_ALL_SERVICES` / `VIEW_OWN_SERVICES`: Viewing permissions

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- ServiceStaff table preserved for additional assignments
- Business-level service queries still work (filtered by businessId)
- Existing API endpoints updated to include staff information

## Usage Examples

### Copy All Owner Services to Staff
```bash
POST /api/v1/services/business/{businessId}/staff/{staffId}/copy-owner-services
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

### Copy Specific Owner Services to Staff
```bash
POST /api/v1/services/business/{businessId}/staff/{staffId}/copy-owner-services
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "serviceIds": ["svc_123", "svc_456"]
}
```

### Get Services Owned by Staff Member
```bash
GET /api/v1/services/staff/{staffId}?activeOnly=true
```

### Get Owner Services for a Business
```bash
GET /api/v1/services/business/{businessId}/owner-services
```

## Migration Process
1. **Database Migration**: Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name services_to_staff`
2. **Data Migration**: The migration SQL automatically assigns existing services to business owners
3. **Client Generation**: `npx prisma generate` to update Prisma client
4. **Build & Deploy**: Standard deployment process

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Successful
- Prisma schema validation: ✅ Valid
- API endpoint structure: ✅ Properly defined
- Permission integration: ✅ RBAC compliant

## Notes for Frontend Integration
- Update service creation forms to handle staff assignment
- Add "Copy Services" button for staff management UI
- Service listings now include staff owner information
- Business service queries remain the same for backward compatibility

The implementation is ready for testing and deployment. All major functionality has been preserved while adding the requested staff-level service ownership and copying capabilities.
