# Production-Ready Graceful Shutdown

This document describes the production-ready graceful shutdown implementation for the application.

## Overview

The graceful shutdown system ensures that the application shuts down cleanly by:
1. Stopping acceptance of new connections
2. Stopping background services (schedulers, reminders)
3. Closing database connections
4. Draining active connections
5. Exiting with appropriate status codes

## Features

### âœ… Production-Ready Features

- **Signal Handling**: Handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeout to prevent hanging shutdowns
- **Service Cleanup**: Stops all background services gracefully
- **Database Cleanup**: Properly disconnects from Prisma database
- **Connection Draining**: Waits for active requests to complete
- **Health Check Integration**: Health endpoint shows shutdown readiness
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with emojis and timing
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and exit codes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all services
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration

### ðŸ”§ Configuration

Environment variables for fine-tuning shutdown behavior:

```bash
# Maximum time to wait for graceful shutdown (default: 30000ms)
SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=30000

# Time to wait for active connections to drain (default: 10000ms)
CONNECTION_DRAIN_TIMEOUT=10000

# Enable/disable connection draining (default: true)
ENABLE_CONNECTION_DRAINING=true

# Enable/disable database cleanup (default: true)
ENABLE_DATABASE_CLEANUP=true
```

### ðŸ“Š Health Check Integration

The health check endpoint (`/health`) now includes shutdown readiness:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "shutdown": {
      "status": "ready",
      "ready": true
    }
  }
}
```

When shutting down, the status changes to:
```json
{
  "checks": {
    "shutdown": {
      "status": "shutting_down",
      "ready": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The graceful shutdown is automatically configured in the main application:

```typescript
import { gracefulShutdown, setServicesForShutdown } from './utils/gracefulShutdown';

// Set services for shutdown
setServicesForShutdown(services);

// Signal handlers are automatically set up
process.on("SIGTERM", async () => await gracefulShutdown(server));
process.on("SIGINT", async () => await gracefulShutdown(server));
```

### Service Integration

Services that need cleanup should implement the `ShutdownableService` interface:

```typescript
interface ShutdownableService {
  stop(): void | Promise<void>;
}
```

### Database Integration

The system automatically handles Prisma database disconnection:

```typescript
interface DatabaseService {
  $disconnect(): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Shutdown Process

1. **Signal Received**: `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` received
2. **Duplicate Check**: Prevents multiple shutdown attempts
3. **Stop New Connections**: Server stops accepting new requests
4. **Stop Services**: Background services are stopped gracefully
5. **Database Cleanup**: Database connections are closed
6. **Connection Draining**: Wait for active requests to complete
7. **Exit**: Process exits with appropriate status code

## Logging

The shutdown process provides detailed logging:

```
ðŸ”„ Received shutdown signal, shutting down gracefully...
ðŸš« Stopping acceptance of new connections...
ðŸ”„ Stopping subscriptionSchedulerService...
âœ… subscriptionSchedulerService stopped successfully
ðŸ”„ Stopping appointmentSchedulerService...
âœ… appointmentSchedulerService stopped successfully
ðŸ”„ Closing database connections...
âœ… Database connections closed successfully
ðŸ”„ Draining connections... (0 active, 1000ms elapsed)
âœ… All active connections drained
âœ… Graceful shutdown completed in 2500ms
```

## Error Handling

- **Service Errors**: Individual service errors are logged but don't stop shutdown
- **Database Errors**: Database errors are logged and may cause shutdown failure
- **Timeout**: If shutdown exceeds timeout, process is forcefully terminated
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors)

## Production Deployment

### Docker

For Docker deployments, ensure proper signal handling:

```dockerfile
# Use exec form to ensure signals reach the process
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Kubernetes

For Kubernetes deployments:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        lifecycle:
          preStop:
            exec:
              command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 15"]
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

### Load Balancer

Configure your load balancer to:
1. Stop sending new requests when health check shows `shutdown.ready: false`
2. Wait for `CONNECTION_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` before removing from rotation
3. Respect the `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` for maximum wait time

## Monitoring

Monitor shutdown behavior with:

- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint shows shutdown readiness
- **Logs**: Structured logging with timing information
- **Metrics**: Track shutdown duration and success rates
- **Alerts**: Alert on failed shutdowns or excessive shutdown times

## Best Practices

1. **Test Shutdown**: Regularly test shutdown process in staging
2. **Monitor Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for your workload
3. **Health Checks**: Use health checks to prevent traffic during shutdown
4. **Logging**: Monitor shutdown logs for issues
5. **Database**: Ensure database connections are properly closed
6. **Services**: All background services should implement proper stop methods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hanging Shutdown**: Increase `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`
2. **Database Errors**: Check Prisma connection status
3. **Service Errors**: Verify all services implement `stop()` method
4. **Connection Draining**: Adjust `CONNECTION_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot shutdown issues:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will provide more detailed logging during the shutdown process.
