# Production Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Production Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy production environment template
cp .env.production .env

# Update all CHANGE_ME values with secure credentials
nano .env
```

### 2. Generate Secure Keys

```bash
# Generate JWT secrets (run these commands and copy output to .env)
echo "JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)"
echo "JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)"
echo "COOKIE_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
echo "SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Generate strong database passwords
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

### 3. SSL Certificate Setup

```bash
# For production with domain
./scripts/setup-letsencrypt.sh yourdomain.com

# For development/testing
./scripts/generate-dev-certs.sh
```

### 4. Start Production Environment

```bash
# Build and start all services
make prod-up

# Check health status
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# View logs
make prod-logs
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All CHANGE_ME values updated in .env
- [ ] Strong passwords generated (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] CORS origins updated to production domains
- [ ] Database SSL mode enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately

### Database Security
- [ ] Strong database password set
- [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled for database connections
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Connection pooling optimized

### Application Security
- [ ] JWT secrets are cryptographically secure
- [ ] Session security configured
- [ ] Helmet security headers enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting in place
- [ ] File upload limits set appropriately
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization verified

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Firewall rules configured (only necessary ports open)
- [ ] Container security scanning completed
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Log aggregation configured

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Endpoint
- **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/health`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive health check including database connectivity
- **Expected Response**: HTTP 200 with detailed status information

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus metrics**: Available at `:9090/metrics`
- **Key metrics**: Response times, error rates, memory usage, database connections

### Logging
- **Format**: Structured JSON logging
- **Location**: `/var/log/randevubu/app.log`
- **Log Levels**: error, warn, info (production uses 'warn' level)

## ðŸ”„ Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- **Schedule**: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Storage**: AWS S3 encrypted bucket
- **Restoration**: Automated scripts available

### Application Backups
- **Code**: Version controlled in Git
- **Uploads**: Stored in AWS S3 with versioning
- **Configuration**: Environment variables backed up securely

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Failures
```bash
# Check database status
docker exec randevubu-postgres-prod pg_isready -U postgres

# Check logs
make prod-logs-all
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check certificate expiry
openssl x509 -in nginx/ssl/cert.pem -noout -dates

# Renew certificates
./scripts/renew-ssl.sh
```

#### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Check memory usage
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# Restart application if needed
docker restart randevubu-server-prod
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Current setup supports 2 application replicas
- Load balanced through nginx
- Database connection pooling configured

### Vertical Scaling
- Monitor memory and CPU usage through health endpoint
- Adjust container resource limits in docker-compose.prod.yml
- Database can be scaled independently

### Performance Optimization
- Redis caching implemented
- Gzip compression enabled
- Static file serving optimized
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor SSL certificate expiry (auto-renewal configured)
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets quarterly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review and optimize database performance
- [ ] Check backup integrity monthly

### Security Updates
- [ ] Apply OS security patches
- [ ] Update Node.js runtime
- [ ] Update dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
1. Check environment variables are properly set
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check SSL certificate validity
4. Review application logs

### Performance Issues
1. Check `/health` endpoint for system metrics
2. Monitor database connection pool
3. Review nginx access logs for traffic patterns
4. Check memory and CPU usage

### SSL Issues
1. Verify certificate files exist and are readable
2. Check certificate expiry dates
3. Validate certificate chain
4. Test SSL configuration
