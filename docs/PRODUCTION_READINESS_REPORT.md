### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendations (Before Going Live)

#### 1. Add Email Service Integration
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH

Currently, email notifications are not implemented. You need to integrate an email service:

**Options:**
- **SendGrid** (Recommended for startups - 100 free emails/day)
- **AWS SES** (Best for AWS infrastructure)
- **Mailgun** (Good balance of features and price)
- **Postmark** (Excellent deliverability)

**Implementation File:** `src/services/domain/notification/notificationService.ts:231`

---

#### 2. Add Test Coverage
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM

Currently, there are only test stubs. For production confidence:

**Minimum Coverage:**
- Unit tests for business logic (70% coverage target)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database migration tests (already in CI/CD)

**Note:** Test infrastructure is in place via CI/CD pipeline (job 6), just disabled until tests are written.

---

#### 3. Set Up Error Tracking
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM

Add production error tracking:

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Sentry** (Best for Node.js, free tier available)
- **Rollbar** (Good alternative)
- **LogRocket** (Includes session replay)

**Integration:** Can be added to Winston logger transport.

---

#### 4. Configure Production Secrets
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH

Before deploying:

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# JWT Secrets (generate strong random strings)
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<generate-256-bit-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<generate-256-bit-secret>

# Database (production URL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@prod-host:5432/db

# Redis (production URL)
REDIS_URL=redis://prod-redis:6379

# AWS S3 (for file uploads)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket>

# Email Service (choose one)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your-key>
# OR
AWS_SES_REGION=us-east-1

# SSL/HTTPS
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem
```

---

#### 5. Set Up Monitoring & Alerting
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM

Configure monitoring dashboards:

**What's Already Available:**
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Structured JSON logs

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up Grafana dashboards (sample configs in `monitoring/`)
2. Configure alert rules (high error rate, slow responses, etc.)
3. Set up PagerDuty or similar for on-call alerts
